Coinductive Representation of Graphs - Code for Celia Picard's PhD thesis

This repository tries to maintain the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) code of Celia Picard's 2012 thesis at University of Toulouse 3.

The thesis advisor was [Ralph Matthes](https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/) who hosts Celia Picard's thesis on his personal web page, at [https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/ThesePicard/](https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/ThesePicard/).

Installation instructions are found in (INSTALL.txt)[INSTALL.txt].
There is a list of correspondances between the thesis text and the code:  (correspondances.pdf)[correspondances.pdf].

The files for Coq 8.4 beta still compile fine with Coq 8.4pl6 - regardless of whether with provided makefile or the one generated with coq_makefile from Coq 8.4pl6 provided here (taken from a remark of July 2015 by Ralph Matthes).
