Coinductive Representation of Graphs - Code for Celia Picard's PhD thesis

This repository tries to maintain the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) code of Celia Picard's 2012 thesis at University of Toulouse 3.

The thesis advisor was [Ralph Matthes](https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/) who hosts Celia Picard's thesis on his personal web page, at [https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/ThesePicard/](https://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/ThesePicard/).

Installation instructions are found in (INSTALL.txt)[INSTALL.txt].
There is a list of correspondances between the thesis text and the code:  (correspondances.pdf)[correspondances.pdf].

Version from 2021, tested with Coq 8.7.2. The code correspondences with the thesis text are still mostly correct. No installation instructions - just run `make` (maybe after `make clean`). The versions numbers for all the files are omitted - better trace the version history through GitHub.
